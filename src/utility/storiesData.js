    testimonial:
      "Alexandra's way with dogs (and humans, for that matter) is unmatched! My family and I have been German Shepherd owners for years - 3 over the course of 20 years - and each one of them has been such a blessing, thanks very much in part to Alexandra! She has taught us how to employ the training habits we have learned in an effort to create environments where our dogs can succeed and thus become confident enough to interact with people and/or dogs in a healthy, social manner.  Our German Shepherd was attacked by a dog in a dog park and Alexandra was immediately there to help us `rehabilitate` him with healthy, positive interactions with other friendly dogs, so that our precious boy wasn't forever scarred by the experience.  She makes herself constantly available for guidance and encouragement, all the while being very honest about what needs to be done to create the type of obedient dog that every owner desires. Alex has a fantastic grasp on what dogs and their owners need from one another in order to foster a loving, trusting relationship.  At the TOP of our list of ways we rave about Alexandra is the way she has come to love our furbabies as her own. They LOVE spending time with Alex, because they TRUST her, which makes every aspect of the training experience that much more enjoyable.  Anyone who entrusts Alexandra with their dogs is making a wise decision that will not only lead to years of obedient behavior, but years of wonderful friendship, as well! ",

      "While she won’t mention it much it’s true that Alexandra received the Dog trainer of the Year in Atlanta, GA.  Our Co-Founder, Matt’s training style is a combination of several phenomenal dog trainers whether that was learning from them in person or via videos, webinars, etc.  On a daily basis when Matt sees a dog reach another level he thanks Alexandra for the knowledge she gave him.  Watching Alexandra work with a dog is a once in a lifetime experience which will take your breath away. Her heart, love for people and animals can’t be described.  She inspires us and resides in our minds and hearts.  Much love.",

      "Alexandra has been a life saver for me and my rather energetic dog Ella. Aussie’s are smart, but almost too smart for their own good, getting into all sorts of doggie trouble. Alexandra is always one step ahead of Ella, anticipating her thoughts and actions - and helping me to understand what I can do to ensure that Ella stays a happy and well-behaved dog. Alexandra starting working with Ella at about 8 weeks - and has worked miracles with us both!",

Her knowledgeable training skills and patience put forth to each and every dog in the class was remarkable to witness. Every dog transformed during the course of a few weeks of training. We were able to practice the daily lessons with our dog successfully. The behavioral issues our dog once had have been overturned! Tails Wag Dog Training has been a necessity to the overall happiness we now share with our happily trained dog!",

She trained our dog at 6 months, and when issues like moving to a new residence arose later, she was there to help us. She goes above and beyond the call of duty and I would recommend her to anyone with any kind or dog, with any kind of issues. She is really fabulous.",

My family and I have done both and we have been quite impressed with Alexandra’s ability to get to know each dog she is working with and tailor the training as needed. She and her staff are positive, hardworking, and a pleasure to be with. Whether you need basic training (with a puppy or adult dog) or help with a specific problem, they will provide exceptional service for reasonable fees.",

      "We looked long and hard for a good dog trainer in Atlanta, and Tails Wag was all that we were looking for. With years of experience, Alexandra understands dog behavior and psychology, and was able to help us confidently gain and keep the upper hand with a large,  stubborn, and rambunctious puppy! We frequently get comments from neighbors and other dog owners about how well behaved she is. In addition to training the dogs, Alexandra does a great job of teaching dog parents how to train dogs. We have successfully completed her basic obedience course and look forward to signing up for an intermediate obedience course in the near future. I would strongly recommend Tails Wag to anyone looking for positive and effective obedience training for their dog.",

We also took her to the group classes which we found to be almost as helpful as the one-on-one earlier. It all changed our life because we had a better dog! Alexandra’s compassion and willingness to go above & beyond the call of duty is only one of the reasons I would recommend her without hesitation.",
